#This project was developed as part of the Neural Networks course at the Computer Science Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. It evolves implementation of an Auto-encoder that recognizes the digits of MNIST database images and generates the next digit of the one given as input. A digit recognizer NN follows to test if the generated digit is being identified correctly. For more information, please refer to the report (in Greek).
